# Listening and Active Communication

**Question 1: What are the steps/strategies to do Active Listening? (Minimum 6 points)**

1. **Pay Full Attention**: Focus entirely on the speaker without distractions. Maintain eye contact and refrain from interrupting.
2. **Show That You're Listening**: Use non-verbal cues like nodding, smiling, or saying "I see" to indicate that you're engaged.
3. **Provide Feedback**: Paraphrase or summarize what the speaker has said to ensure understanding and show that you are processing the information.
4. **Defer Judgment**: Allow the speaker to finish their point without interrupting or immediately forming a rebuttal.
5. **Respond Appropriately**: Offer thoughtful responses or questions that show you have genuinely considered the speaker's message.
6. **Reflect on What’s Said**: Think about the underlying emotions and intentions behind the words to better understand the speaker’s perspective.

**Question 2: According to Fisher's model, what are the key points of Reflective Listening? (Write in your own words, use simple English)**

1. **Understanding the Speaker**: Reflective listening involves fully understanding what the speaker is trying to convey before responding.
2. **Mirroring Emotions**: You need to not only hear the words but also recognize and reflect the speaker's emotions, helping them feel understood.
3. **Clarification**: This involves asking questions or rephrasing what the speaker has said to ensure that there is no miscommunication.
4. **Validation**: Acknowledge the speaker’s feelings and viewpoints without necessarily agreeing with them, showing respect for their perspective.
5. **Non-verbal Cues**: Pay attention to and mirror the speaker’s body language and tone to create rapport and show empathy.
6. **Providing Feedback**: Offer feedback that confirms you’ve understood both the message and the emotion behind it, fostering trust in the conversation.

**Question 3: What are the obstacles in your listening process?**

- **Distractions**: External noises or internal thoughts can take focus away from the conversation.
- **Prejudgments**: Preconceived notions about the speaker or topic can prevent true understanding.
- **Interruptions**: Jumping in with your thoughts before the speaker has finished can disrupt the listening process.
- **Lack of Interest**: If the topic doesn't seem relevant, it can be challenging to maintain focus.
- **Emotional Responses**: Strong emotions, such as anger or frustration, can block effective listening.

**Question 4: What can you do to improve your listening?**
