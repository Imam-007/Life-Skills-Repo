# Tiny Habits
### Question 1: 
**What was the most interesting story or idea for you in this video?**

The most interesting idea in this video was how small, seemingly insignificant actions can lead to major behavior changes over time. The concept of anchoring new habits to existing routines, such as doing two push-ups after brushing your teeth, demonstrates how easily tiny habits can be incorporated into daily life with minimal effort.

### Question 2:
**How can you use B = MAP to make new habits easier? What are M, A, and P?**

B = MAP stands for Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt. 
- **M (Motivation)**: Your desire to perform the behavior. 
- **A (Ability)**: How easy or difficult the behavior is to perform.
- **P (Prompt)**: A cue that triggers the behavior.

To make new habits easier, reduce the difficulty (increase Ability), create a clear Prompt (such as setting a reminder), and tap into your Motivation (by making the habit personally rewarding).

### Question 3:
**Why is it important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of a habit?**

Celebrating, or "Shining," after completing a habit is crucial because it reinforces the behavior by creating positive emotions associated with it. This positive reinforcement strengthens the habit and makes you more likely to repeat it in the future. Essentially, whatever you celebrate becomes a habit.

### Question 4:
**What was the most interesting story or idea for you in this video?**

The most interesting idea was the power of incremental improvement. The concept of getting 1% better every day shows how small, consistent efforts compound over time, leading to significant progress. The video emphasized that continuous improvement, even in tiny amounts, can result in extraordinary long-term success.

### Question 5:
**What is the book's perspective about Identity?**

"Atomic Habits" emphasizes that habits are linked to your identity. The book suggests that instead of focusing on the outcome (e.g., "I want to lose weight"), it's more effective to focus on your identity (e.g., "I am a healthy person"). When you believe that your habits align with your identity, you are more likely to stick with them.

### Question 6:
**Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do.**

The book suggests that making a habit easier involves reducing the friction around performing it. This can be achieved through strategies such as the "Two-Minute Rule," where you break the habit down into something that takes two minutes or less, or by simplifying the environment to make the habit more accessible, such as placing running shoes by the door if you want to run more.

### Question 7:
**Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do.**

To make a habit harder to do, the book suggests increasing the friction or difficulty of performing the habit. This could involve adding steps between you and the unwanted habit, such as storing junk food in an inconvenient location or setting up digital distractions like social media behind passwords or app blockers.

### Question 8:
**Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make the cue obvious, or the habit more attractive, easy, or satisfying?**

*Habit*: Daily reading

**Steps**:
- **Cue**: Place the book on my pillow in the morning as a reminder to read before bed.
- **Attractive**: Pair reading with a cup of tea, making it a relaxing ritual.
- **Easy**: Set a goal to read just five pages a day, removing any pressure to finish entire chapters.
- **Satisfying**: Celebrate each completed reading session by marking progress in a reading journal.

### Question 9:
**Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make the cue invisible, or the process unattractive, hard, or the response unsatisfying?**

*Habit*: Excessive screen time (e.g., scrolling on social media)

**Steps**:
- **Invisible**: Turn off all notifications and place the phone in another room when working.
- **Unattractive**: Set the screen to grayscale to make social media apps visually less appealing.
- **Hard**: Delete apps from the phone, making them only accessible through the web browser.
- **Unsatisfying**: Set a timer to limit usage, and track wasted time to visualize the lost productivity.
