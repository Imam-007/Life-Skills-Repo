# Tiny Habits
### Question 1: 
**What was the most interesting story or idea for you in this video?**

The coolest idea was how doing small things, like 2 push-ups after brushing your teeth, can make a big difference over time.

### Question 2:
**How can you use B = MAP to make new habits easier? What are M, A, and P?**

B = MAP means Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt.
 **Motivation**: How much you feel like doing it.
 **Ability**: How easy or hard it is to do.
 **Prompt**: Something that reminds you to do it.

To make a habit easier, pick something simple to start, set up a clear reminder, and stay motivated by making the habit enjoyable or useful for yourself.

### Question 3:
**Why is it important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of a habit?**

Celebrating after you finish a habit is important because it makes you feel good, which makes you want to keep doing it. That happy feeling helps lock in the habit.

### Question 4:
**What was the most interesting story or idea for you in this video?**

The idea of improving just 1% every day was really interesting. Even small steps forward can add up to big results if you keep at it consistently.

### Question 5:
**What is the book's perspective about Identity?**

The book talks about how habits are tied to who you think you are. Instead of just thinking about what you want to achieve, itâ€™s better to focus on your identity. This makes sticking to the habit easier.

### Question 6:
**Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do.**

The book suggests making a habit easier by removing obstacles. You can break the habit into smaller parts (like the Two-Minute Rule) or set things up so the habit is easy to start, like keeping your running shoes by the door if you want to run more.

### Question 7:
**Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do.**

If you want to stop a bad habit, the book says to make it harder to do. You can create barriers, like putting junk food somewhere hard to reach or using tools to block distractions like social media.

### Question 8:
**Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make the cue obvious, or the habit more attractive, easy, or satisfying?**

*Habit*: Daily reading

**Steps**:
 - Leave the book on my bed, so I remember to read before sleeping.
 - Pair reading with tea, so it feels like a nice, relaxing time.
 - Just aim to read 5 pages a day to keep it simple.

### Question 9:
**Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make the cue invisible, or the process unattractive, hard, or the response unsatisfying?**

*Habit*: Excessive screen time (e.g., scrolling on social media)

**Steps**:
-  Turn off notifications and leave my phone in another room.
-  Set my phone to grayscale to make it less appealing.
-  Delete the apps from my phone and only use them on a browser.
-  Track how much time I waste to see the impact on my productivity.
