### Question 1
 **What is the Feynman Technique?** 
  - The Feynman Technique involves explaining a concept in simple terms to identify gaps in understanding.

### Question 2
 **What was the most interesting story or idea in the video?**
- A common interesting point from Barbara Oakley's talks is her story about how she struggled with math in her youth and later became an engineer and educator. She often emphasizes that anyone can learn difficult subjects with the right techniques and mindset.

### Question 3
 **What are active and diffused modes of thinking?**
  - **Active Mode**: Focused, deliberate thinking often used when tackling complex problems.
  - **Diffused Mode**: Relaxed, less concentrated thinking that allows your mind to form connections between ideas.

### Question 4
 **what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic?**:
1. **Deconstruct the skill**: Break down the skill into smaller, manageable parts.
2. **Learn enough to self-correct**: Get enough information so that you can recognize and correct mistakes during practice.
3. **Remove practice barriers**: Identify and eliminate anything that might prevent you from practicing consistently.
4. **Practice for at least 20 hours**: Commit to putting in a minimum of 20 hours of focused practice to reach a basic level of proficiency.

### Question 5

**What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?**

- **Apply the Feynman Technique**: Regularly explain concepts in simple terms to identify and fill knowledge gaps.
- **Use Active and Diffused Modes**: Alternate between focused study sessions (active mode) and relaxed thinking (diffused mode) to enhance problem-solving.
- **Set Clear Goals**: Define specific, achievable learning goals with deadlines to stay motivated and track progress.
- **Practice Consistently**: Dedicate regular time to practice and reinforce new skills or concepts.
- **Reflect and Review**: Periodically review what you've learned and reflect on areas for improvement to solidify understanding.
- **Seek Feedback**: Get feedback from peers or mentors to gain different perspectives and improve your approach.
- **Limit Distractions**: Create a focused learning environment by minimizing distractions to increase concentration and productivity.
